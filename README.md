### Hey 😁 I'm Me4502

I'm a Software Engineer at [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/) 🎬. We make an entirely client-side in-browser video editor 🤯.

I also do a lot of work on Minecraft-related projects. Some of what I work on is,

- [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit/)
- [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard/)
- [CraftBook](https://enginehub.org/craftbook/)
- [And many more things!](https://madelinemiller.dev/minecraft/)

I also maintain a [blog](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/) 📝, and a [personal portfolio site](https://madelinemiller.dev/)!
