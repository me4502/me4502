### Hey 😁 I'm Maddy / Me4502 🎉

I'm a Software Engineer at [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/) 🎬 at Microsoft mostly working in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). We make an entirely client-side in-browser video editor 🤯.

I also do a lot of work on Minecraft-related projects. Some of what I work on is,

- [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit/)
- [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard/)
- [CraftBook](https://enginehub.org/craftbook/)
- [And many more things!](https://madelinemiller.dev/minecraft/)

I also have a [blog](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/) 📝 where I write about random tech or other things, and a [personal portfolio site](https://madelinemiller.dev/) that contains a lot of things I've made!
